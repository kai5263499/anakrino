        <div contenteditable="true" id="text_0" color="yellow">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was
        said by some that John had risen from the dead,
        8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again.
        9 Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he
        kept trying to see Him.</div>
        <div contenteditable="true" id="text_1" color="red">And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, "John the
        Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him."
        15 But others were saying, "He is Elijah." And others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the
        prophets of old."
        16 But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen!"
        17 For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the
        wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.
        18 For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
        19 Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not do so;
        20 for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe.
        And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him.
        21 A strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military
        commanders and the leading men of Galilee;
        22 and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner
        guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you."
        23 And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom."
        24 And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And she said, "The head of John the
        Baptist."
        25 Immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the
        head of John the Baptist on a platter."
        26 And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he
        was unwilling to refuse her.
        27 Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went
        and had him beheaded in the prison,
        28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
        29 When his disciples heard about this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.</div>
        <div contenteditable="true" id="text_2" color="blue">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,
        2 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why
        miraculous powers are at work in him."
        3 For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife
        of his brother Philip.
        4 For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
        5 Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a
        prophet.
        6 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,
        7 so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
        8 Having been prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the
        Baptist."
        9 Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths, and because of his
        dinner guests.
        10 He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
        11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
        12 His disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.</div>
